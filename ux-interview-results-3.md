## Interview 1: An intern

- Working against commit 9c8c12d56306da2acff4c24c674a6942e61cac08

- Rob facilitating with a 30 minute tactical substitution from the legendary Al Hall

### Profile

- Hasn't used Java before, other than for a job interview. Inevitably has no idea about spring or mockito either.

- Is rusty, having just finished university, studying Engineering at Cambridge, specialising in information
  engineering.

- Has built a simple REST API before

- Has used HTTP works

- Isn't familar with any navigation, refactoring or suggestion shortcuts in IntelliJ

- Has written automated tests before, although not an experienced practitioner

### Observations

- Not sure what to do after reading the task description

- [Quote] "Where should I implement this?"

- First thing he does is look at the file structure, including the scripts and even the pom.

- Starts reading the product readme, named README.md.

- Upon reaching the section of the readme instructing the reader to immediately go and run the tests, he
  looks through the files, looks at the script "run-tests", hesitates for a moment, then opens the terminal in
  intellij and runs "./run-tests". He watches them pass, then goes back to reading the README.
