    What is this class?
        This is the entry point of the program. It is called Main because the first thing
        you learn in Java is that `Main` is the entry point.
        This is one example of "The Power of Sameness".

    How does this API work?
        The Springboot framework uses the Spring framework to automatically route incoming
        HTTP requests into the application at specified points. Those points are the
        _Mappings_ defined within classes annotated with _@RestController_, in this case,
        our @RestController class is called HttpRequestReceiver.
        _Mappings_ are methods which are annotated with mapping annotations, such as @GetMapping,
        @PostMapping or more generally, @RequestMapping.

    Where's the entry point to this program?
        The annotated methods in HttpRequestReceiver are the entry points. Incoming HTTP requests
        are encoded into instances of HttpServletRequest and passed into those methods as
        parameters. The return type of these methods is ResponseEntity<String>, which means
        a HTTP response with the response body given as a string. This return value is then
        encoded by the Springboot framework into a HTTP response and sent back to the
        original sender.
