$H PAPI Core Product

$H What is this?

- The PAPI Core Product is a set of resources for helping you to build a Springboot HTTP REST API.

- The generated code is all yours and you should own it as such.

- The code has been designed specifically for _extensibility_ and _flexibility_, so that it is as easy
  as possible for you to add new functionality without modifying lots of existing code, but instead by
  extending the codebase with new classes to support the needs of your API.
